##B2G configuration for kumquat devices.

### Devices configurations adapted from the cyanogen mod project :
- [kumquat](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_sony_kumquat/tree/ics)
- [montblanc-common](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_sony_montblanc-common)

### Repo manifest adapted from [https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/b2g-manifest/blob/master/galaxy-nexus.xml](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/b2g-manifest/blob/master/galaxy-nexus.xml)

### The kernel has to be built separately.
It's easier to pull the existing one from the device and path it with the provided init.rc.
